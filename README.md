# Weather-Forecast
Weather-Forecast

This code was part of a "creating from scratch" type of code. We had to start from scratch, therefore had to create the index.html, script.js, and style.css
We wer given an 'Acceptance Criteria' to fulfill for this project. Below is the 'Acceptance Criteria'.

CHALLENGES

So far the hardest javascript challenge. Extremly difficult. I had to rely on going over my notes in class, reading a lot of information online mostly using Mozilla and a bit of W3schoos.
Reading on stack overflow to at least help me how to start or get some understanding on building the weather forecast. Some of the code from the stack overflow really helped. Watching various types of videos and tutorials online to help me build a 5-day forecast.
So far the most complex. I had a lot of trouble on most of my functions. I did write pseudo-code for myself, but the execution of the code is still the most difficult.
My biggest hurdle at the time of starting to code was just trying to display the current weather with the 5-day forecast. I was stuck on trying to get the temp, humidity, wind, etc. to display when I would fetch the request.
I also didn't not know how to get the information, until I started to console.log. When I did that, it became easier because all the info was there and I just had to use dot notation to access them.
For most of the functions, it was hard trying to memorize code. I still rely on notes, videos, tutorials, etc. to assit me with code building. 
I will need to practice a lot for these type of complex coding. I do understand how the code works on its own, but sometimes when things combine it becomes difficult for me to understand.

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
